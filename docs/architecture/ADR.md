# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

## ADR-001: Microservices Architecture Selection

**Date**: 2024-01-15  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Decision Makers**: Senior Engineering Team

### Context
The Medicine Management ChatBot system requires high scalability, maintainability, and the ability to deploy services independently. The system needs to handle varying loads across different functionalities (billing, inventory, AI processing).

### Decision
Adopt a microservices architecture with the following service boundaries:
- Authentication Service
- Billing Service  
- Inventory Service
- AI/ML Service
- Notification Service
- Analytics Service

### Rationale
- **Scalability**: Each service can be scaled independently based on demand
- **Technology Diversity**: Different services can use optimal technology stacks
- **Team Autonomy**: Different teams can work on services independently
- **Fault Isolation**: Failure in one service doesn't bring down the entire system
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Services can be deployed independently with zero downtime

### Consequences
**Positive**:
- Better resource utilization
- Faster feature development
- Technology flexibility
- Improved fault tolerance

**Negative**:
- Increased operational complexity
- Network latency between services
- Distributed system challenges (eventual consistency, distributed transactions)
- More complex testing and debugging

## ADR-002: Database Strategy - Polyglot Persistence

**Date**: 2024-01-16  
**Status**: Accepted

### Context
Different services have varying data storage requirements. Billing requires ACID compliance, inventory needs fast reads/writes, AI service needs flexible schema, and analytics requires complex querying capabilities.

### Decision
Implement polyglot persistence with:
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary transactional database (billing, user management)
- **Redis**: Caching and session storage
- **Elasticsearch**: Full-text search and analytics
- **Apache Kafka**: Event streaming and message queuing

### Rationale
- **PostgreSQL**: ACID compliance, mature ecosystem, excellent for transactional data
- **Redis**: Sub-millisecond latency, perfect for caching and real-time features
- **Elasticsearch**: Superior full-text search capabilities for medicine database
- **Kafka**: Reliable event streaming for microservices communication

## ADR-003: API Design - RESTful with GraphQL Gateway

**Date**: 2024-01-17  
**Status**: Accepted

### Context
Frontend applications need efficient data fetching with minimal over-fetching, while maintaining simple RESTful interfaces for individual services.

### Decision
- Individual services expose RESTful APIs
- API Gateway provides GraphQL endpoint for frontend applications
- OpenAPI 3.0 specification for all REST APIs
- Standardized error handling and response formats

### Rationale
- REST APIs are simple and well-understood
- GraphQL reduces over-fetching and under-fetching
- OpenAPI ensures consistent API documentation
- Standardized responses improve developer experience

## ADR-004: Authentication and Authorization Strategy

**Date**: 2024-01-18  
**Status**: Accepted

### Context
The system requires secure authentication for different user types (pharmacy staff, customers, administrators) with fine-grained authorization controls.

### Decision
- OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect for authentication
- JWT tokens with short expiration times
- Refresh token rotation for enhanced security
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with attribute-based extensions
- API Gateway handles authentication and authorization

### Rationale
- Industry standard protocols
- Stateless authentication suitable for microservices
- Fine-grained access control
- Centralized security enforcement

---

## ADR-005: Monitoring and Observability

**Date**: 2024-01-19  
**Status**: Accepted

### Context
Distributed systems require comprehensive monitoring, logging, and tracing to ensure reliability and facilitate debugging.

### Decision
Implement the three pillars of observability:
- **Metrics**: Prometheus with Grafana dashboards
- **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- **Tracing**: Jaeger for distributed tracing
- **Alerting**: PagerDuty integration for critical alerts

### Rationale
- Industry-standard observability stack
- Comprehensive system visibility
- Efficient troubleshooting capabilities
- Proactive issue detection

## ADR-006: AI/ML Model Deployment Strategy

**Date**: 2024-01-20  
**Status**: Accepted

### Context
The system requires real-time AI inference for chatbot responses, drug interaction checking, and demand forecasting.

### Decision
- TensorFlow Serving for model deployment
- Model versioning with MLflow
- A/B testing framework for model comparison
- Feature store (Feast) for consistent feature serving
- Separate AI service with dedicated GPU resources

### Rationale
- Production-ready model serving
- Consistent feature engineering
- Data-driven model improvements
- Scalable inference capabilities

## ADR-007: Frontend State Management

**Date**: 2024-01-21  
**Status**: Accepted

### Context
Complex frontend application with real-time updates, form management, and extensive API interactions.

### Decision
- Redux Toolkit for global state management
- RTK Query for server state and caching
- React Hook Form for form state
- React Query for additional server state needs
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates

### Rationale
- Predictable state management
- Efficient server state handling
- Optimized form performance
- Real-time user experience

## ADR-008: Security and Compliance Framework

**Date**: 2024-01-22  
**Status**: Accepted

### Context
Healthcare systems require strict security measures and regulatory compliance (HIPAA, FDA regulations).

### Decision
- Security by design principles
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- HashiCorp Vault for secrets management
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Compliance automation with policy as code
- Data anonymization for non-production environments

### Rationale
- Regulatory compliance requirements
